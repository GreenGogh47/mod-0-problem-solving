# Given a sentence with only lowercase letters,
# print the same sentence with the first letter
# of every word capitalized.
# For example, if you were given "Turing is the best",
# return "Turing Is The Best" instead!


# # Overall goal
# Make it so any sentence given
# will return with the first letter
# of every word capitalized


# # Pseudocode
# 1. Define a string with a variable
# 2. capitalize every words first letter with the
# capitalize method
# 3. print the result



# Final Solution (in progress)
# If I were on rails I could just use .titleize lol

string = "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey."
p string.uppercase.first
